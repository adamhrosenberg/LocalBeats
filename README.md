## Development Environment Setup
To run project:
1. Install Node.js and NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. After Node and NPM are installed, open a terminal and install Angular:
`npm install -g @angular/cli`
3. To run the Angular project on the local Node development server, navigate into the root of the project and use this command at the terminal:
`ng serve`
4. After Angular and its CLI are installed, install Express.js which will act as our backend for the REST API and web server:
`npm install --save express body-parser`
5. We will create a directory called `server` in the project directory with a `server.js` file which will house the server code implementation for Express
6. When the `server.js` exists, to run the project with Express:
`ng build`
`node server.js`
